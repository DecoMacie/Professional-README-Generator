# Professional README
  # <Your-Project-Title>

  ## Description
  
  - When creating an open source project on GitHub, it‚Äôs important to have a high-quality README for the app;
  - This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions;
  - This last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project;
  - The project generates a README file by using a command-line application. This allows project creators to devote more time to working on the project itself.
