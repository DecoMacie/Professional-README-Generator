  ## Description
  
  - The increasing cost of living suggests better income management;
  - This planner will hopefully help the common householder on their monthly income management;
  - The application offers to the user a better visibility on their monthly income and expenses;
  - During the development of this project I realised that in most cases better Budget management is all it takes to get through these hard times.
